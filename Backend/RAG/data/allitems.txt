Voter Comments:
Christey> A Bugtraq posting indicates that the bug has to do with
   "short packets with certain options set," so the description
   should be modified accordingly.
   
   But is this the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related
   to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in
   BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release
   The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.
   The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, 
   CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.
   The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.
   So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though
   CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux
   and other OSes besides FreeBSD.
Frech> XF:teardrop(338)
   This assignment was based solely on references to the CERT advisory.
Christey> The description for BID:190, which links to CVE-1999-0052 (a
   FreeBSD advisory), notes that the patches provided by FreeBSD in
   CERT:CA-1998-13 suggest a connection between CVE-1999-0001 and
   CVE-1999-0052.  CERT:CA-1998-13 is too vague to be sure without
   further analysis.

   MSKB:Q154174 (CVE-1999-0015) and MSKB:Q179129 (CVE-1999-0104)
   indicate that CVE-1999-0015 was fixed in NT SP3, but
   CVE-1999-0104 was not.  Thus CD:SF-LOC suggests that the

Voter Comments:
Christey> This should be split into three separate problems based on
   the SNI advisory.  But there's newer information to further
   complicate things.
   
   What do we do about this one?  in 1997 or so, SNI did an
   advisory on this problem.  In early 2000, it was still
   discovered to be present in some Linux systems.  So an 
   SF-DISCOVERY content decision might say that this is a
   long enough time between the two, so this should be recorded
   separately.  But they're the same codebase... so if we keep
   them in the same entry, how do we make sure that this entry
   reflects that some new information has been discovered?
   
   The use of dot notation may help in this regard, to use one
   dot for the original problem as discovered in 1997, and
   another dot for the resurgence of the problem in 2000.
Baker> We should merge these.
Christey> Perhaps this should be NAI-19 instead of NAI-20?
   The original Bugtraq post for the SNI advisory suggests SNI-19:
   BUGTRAQ:19971002 SNI-19:BSD lpd vulnerability

   However, archives of "NAI-0020" point to the lpd vuln.
   
   If I recall correctly, some of the NAI advisory numbers got

   REVIEWING(1) Christey

Voter Comments:
Christey> DUPE CVE-1999-0418 and CVE-1999-0250?
Christey> Dan Bernstein, author of Qmail, says that this is not a
   vulnerability in qmail because Unix has built-in resource
   limits that can restrict the size of a qmail process; other
   limits can be specified by the administrator.  See
   http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html
   
   Significant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail
   list.  The fundamental question appears to be whether 
   application software should set its own limits, or rely
   on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,
   UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that
   the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this
   was refuted by others.
   
   See the following threads at
   http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html
   "Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)"
   "qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service"
   "[PATCH] denial of service"
   "just another qmail denial-of-service"
   "the UNIX way"
   "Time for a reality check"
   
   Also see Bugtraq threads on a different vulnerability that
   is related to this topic:
   BUGTRAQ:19990903 Web servers / possible DOS Attack / mime header flooding
   http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/1998_3/0742.html
Baker> http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html
   Berstein rejects this as a vulnerability, claiming this is a slander campaign by Wietse Venema.
   His page states this is not a qmail problem, rather it is a UNIX problem
   that many apps can consume all available memory, and that the administrator
   is responsible to set limits in the OS, rather than expect applications to
   individually prevent memory exhaustion.  CAN 1999-0250 does appear to
   be a duplicate of this entry, based on the research I have done so far.
   There were two different bugtraq postings, but the second one references
   the first, stating that the new exploit uses perl instead of shell scripting
   to accomplish the same attack/exploit.

Christey> qmail-dos-1.c, as published by Wietse Venema (CVE-1999-0250)
   in "BUGTRAQ:19970612 Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)", does not
   use any RCPT commands.  Instead, it sends long strings
   of "X" characters.  A followup by "super@UFO.ORG" includes
   an exploit that claims to do the same thing; however, that
   exploit does not send long strings of X characters - it sends
   a large number of RCPT commands.  It appears that super@ufo.org
   followed up to the wrong message.
   
   NOTE: the ufo.org domain was purchased by another party in
   2003, so the current owner is not associated with any

   application, is debatable.  Any program making the same (reasonnable)
   assumption is vulnerable, i.e., implements the same vulnerability:
   "Assumption that TCP-three-way handshake is complete after calling Linux
   kernel function accept(), which returns socket after getting SYN.   Result
   is process death by SIGPIPE"
   Moreover, whether it results in DOS (to third parties) depends on the
   process that made the assumption.
   I think that the present entry should be split, one entry for every
   application that implements the vulnerability (really describing threat
   instances, which is what other people think about when we talk about
   vulnerabilities), and one entry for the Linux kernel that allows the
   vulnerability to happen.
Frech> XF:hp-inetd
   XF:linux-inetd-dos
Baker> Since we have an hpux bulletin, the description should not specifically say Linux, should it?  It applies to mulitple OS and should be likely either modified, or in extreme case, recast

   recast to reflect that "...after using a long url..." should be replaced

   "...A defect in multiple releases of Cisco IOS software will cause a Cisco
   router or switch to halt and reload if the IOS HTTP service is enabled,
   browsing to "http://router-ip/anytext?/" is attempted, and the enable
   password is supplied when requested. This defect can be exploited to produce
   a denial of service (DoS) attack."

   application software should set its own limits, or rely
   on limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,
   UNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that
   the suggested configuration was not well documented, but this
   was refuted by others.
   
   See the following threads at
   http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html
   "Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)"
   "qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service"

Baker> This appears to be the same vulnerability listed in CAN 1999-0144.  In reading
   through both bugtraq postings, the one that is referenced by 0144 is
   based on a shell code exploit to cause memory exhaustion. The bugtraq
   posting referenced by this entry refers explicitly to the prior
   posting for 0144, and states that the same effect could be
   accomplished by a perl exploit, which was then attached.

   qmail-dos-1.c, as published by Wietse Venema (CVE-1999-0250)
   in "BUGTRAQ:19970612 Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)", does not
   use any RCPT commands.  Instead, it sends long strings
   of "X" characters.  A followup by "super@UFO.ORG" includes
   an exploit that claims to do the same thing; however, that
   exploit does not send long strings of X characters - it sends
   a large number of RCPT commands.  It appears that super@ufo.org
   followed up to the wrong message.

   and its ilk.  Also see comments on CVE-1999-0001.
   
   See: CVE-1999-0015, CVE-1999-0104, CVE-1999-0257, CVE-1999-0258
   
   Is CVE-1999-0001 the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related
   to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in
   BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release
   The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.
   The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, 
   CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.
   The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.
   So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though
   CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux
   and other OSes besides FreeBSD.
   
   Also see BUGTRAQ:19990909 CISCO and nestea.
   
   Finally, note that there is no fundamental difference between
   nestea and nestea2/nestea-v2; they are different ports that
   exploit the same problem.
   
   The original nestea advisory is at
   http://www.technotronic.com/rhino9/advisories/06.htm
   but notice that the suggested fix is in line 375 of
   ip_fragment.c, not ip_input.c.

   The Sun URL referenced by Dave Baker no longer exists, so I
   wasn't able to verify that it addressed the problem described
   in the Bugtraq post.  This might not even be Sun's
   "Java Web Server," as CVE-2001-0186 describes some product
   called "Free Java Web Server"
Dik> There appears to be some confusion.
   
   The particular bug seems to be on in JWS 1.1beta or 1.1 which was fixed
   in 1.1.2 (get foo.jthml source by appending "." of "\" to URL)
   
   There are other bugs that give access and that require a configuration

Frech> XF:http-cgi-webcom-guestbook
Christey> CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In
   NTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers
   Mnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar
   problem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as
   CVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the "previous report" as
   CVE-1999-0287, which could be found at:
   http://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html
   
   0287 describes an exploit via the "template" hidden variable.
   The exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to
   change the filename to read from the template variable.
   
   The exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable
   directly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also
   encoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to
   the web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287
   and 0467 are the same.

Voter Comments:
Wall> Invalid ICMP datagram fragments causes a denial of service in Windows 95 and
   Windows NT systems.
   Reference: Q154174.
   Jolt is also known as sPING, ICMP bug, Icenewk, and Ping of Death.
   It is a modified teardrop 2 attack.  
Frech> XF:nt-ssping
   ADDREF XF:ping-death
   ADDREF XF:teardrop-mod
   ADDREF XF:mpeix-echo-request-dos
Christey> I can't tell whether the Jolt exploit at:
   
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=1997-06-28&msg=Pine.BSF.3.95q.970629163422.3264A-200000@apollo.tomco.net
   
   is exploiting any different flaw than teardrop does.
CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from NOOP to REVIEWING]
Baker> Jolt (original) is basically just a fragmented oversized ICMP that
   kills Win boxes ala Ping of Death.
   Teardrop is altering the offset in fragmented tcp packets so that the
   end of subsequent fragments is inside first packet...
   Teardrop 2 is UDP packets, if I remember right.
   Seems like Jolt (original, not jolt 2) is just exploit code that
   creates a ping of death (CVE 1999-0128)
Levy> I tend to agree with Baker.
CHANGE> [Armstrong changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
Armstrong> This code does not use fragment overlap.  It is simply a large ICMP echo request.
Christey> See the SCO advisory at:
   http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/advisory.html?id=1411
   which may further clarify the issue.
LeBlanc> This is a hodge-podge of DoS attacks. Jolt isn't the same
   thing as ping of death - POD was an oversized ICMP packet, Jolt froze
   Linux and Solaris (and I think not NT), IIRC Jolt2 did get NT boxes.
   Teardrop and teardrop2 were related attacks (usually ICMP frag attacks),
   but each of these is a distinct vulnerability, affected a discrete group
   of systems, and should have distinct CVE numbers. CVE entries should be
   precise as to what the problem is.
Meunier> I agree with Leblanc in that Jolt is multi-faceted.  Jolt has
   characteristics of Ping of Death AND teardrop, but it doesn't do
   either exactly.  Moreover, it sends a truncated IP fragment.  I
   disagree with Armstrong; jolt uses overlapping fragments.  It's not a
   simple ping of death either.  It may be that the author's intent was
   to construct a "super attack" somehow combining elements of other
   vulnerabilities to try to make it more potent.  In any case it
   succeeded in confusing the CVE board :-).
   
   I notice that Jolt uses echo replies (type 0) instead of echo
   requests (to get past firewalls?).  Jolt is peculiar in that it also
   sends numerous overlapping fragments.  The "Pascal Simulator" :-) says
   it sends:
   
   - 172 fragments of length 400 with offset starting at 5120 and
increasing by about 47 (odd arithmetic of 5120 OR ((n* 380) > > 3)),
   which eventually results in sending fragments inside an already
covered area once ((n* 380) > > 3) is greater than 5120, which occurs
   when n is reaches 108.  This would look a bit like TearDrop if
   fragments were reassembled on-the-fly.
   
   - 1 fragment such that the total length of all the fragments
   is greater than 65535 (my calculation is 172*380 + 418 = 65778; the
   comment about 65538 must be wrong).  The last packet is size 418
   according to the IP header but the buffer is of size 400.  The sendto
   takes as argument the size of the buffer so a truncated packet is
   sent.
   
   So, I am not sure if the problem is because the last packet
   doesn't extend to the payload it says it has or because the total size
   of all fragments is greater than 65535.  The author says it may take
   more than one sending, so perhaps this has to do with an incorrect
   error handling and recovery.  One would need to experiment and isolate
   each of those characteristics and test them independently.  Inasmuch
   as each of those things is likely a different vulnerability, then I
   agree with Leblanc that this entry should be split.  I'll try that if
   I ever get bored.  Jolt 2 should also have a different entry (see
   below).
   
   Jolt 2 runs in an infinite loop, sending the same fragmented
   IP packet, which can pretend to be "ICMP" or "UDP" data; however this
   is meaningless, as it's just a late fragment of an IP packet.  The
   attack works only as long as packets are sent.  According to
   http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/62170 the packets are
   truncated, and would overflow over the 65535 byte limit, which is
   similar to Jolt.  Note that Jolt does send that much data whereas
   jolt2 doesn't.  Since jolt2 is simpler and narrower than jolt, and it
   has weaker consequences, I believe that it's a different
   vulnerability.
   
   "Jolt 2 vulnerability causes a temporary denial-of-service in
   Windows-type OSes" would be a title for it.

Voter Comments:
Christey> Is this the same as CVE-1999-0373?  They both have the same
   X-Force reference.
   
   BID:342 suggests that there are two.
   
   http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990215a suggests
   that there are two.  However, CVE-1999-0373 is written up in
   a fashion that is too general; and both XF:linux-super-bo and
   XF:linux-super-logging-bo refer to CVE-1999-0373.
   CVE-1999-0373 may need to be split.
   
Frech> From what I can surmise, ISS released the original advisory (attached to
   linux-super-bo), and Sekure SDI expanded on it by releasing another related
   overflow in syslog (which is linux-super-logging-bo).
   
   When I was originally assigning these issues, I placed both XF references
   and the ISS advisory on the -0373 candidate, since there was nothing else
   available. Based on the information above, I'd request that
   XF:linux-super-logging-bo be removed from CVE-1999-0373.
Christey> Given Andre's feedback, these are different issues.
   CVE-1999-0373 does not need to be split because the ISS
   reference is sufficient to distinguish that CVE from this
   candidate; however, the CVE-1999-0373 description should
   probably be modified slightly.

Voter Comments:
Christey> Is CVE-1999-0389 a duplicate of CVE-1999-0798?  CVE-1999-0389
   has January 1999 dates associated with it, while CVE-1999-0798
   was reported in late December.
   
   Also, is this the same line of code as CVE-1999-0914?  Both are in
   the netstd package, it could look like a library problem.
   
   However, deep in the changelog in the
   netstd_3.07-7slink.3.diff on Debian, Herbert Xu includes
   the following entry:
   
   +netstd (3.07-7slink.1) frozen; urgency=high
   +
   +  * bootpd:     Applied patch from Redhat as well as a fix for the overflow in
   +                report() (fixes #30675).
   +  * netkit-ftp: Applied patch from RedHat that fixes some obscure overflow

   +
   + -- Herbert Xu <herbert@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Dec 1998 14:36:48 +1100
   
   This tells me that two separate bugs are involved.
   
   Note that Red Hat posted *some* fix for *some* bootp problem
   in June 1998.  See:
   http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/rh42-errata-general.html#bootp

CHANGE> [Christey changed vote from REJECT to REVIEWING]
Christey> The fix information for BID:324 suggests that there are two
   overflows, one of which is in handle_request (bootpd.c) and is
   likely related to a file name; but there is another issue in
   report (report.c) which also looks like a straightforward
   overflow, which would suggest that this is not a duplicate of
   CVE-1999-0798 or CVE-1999-0799.

Unless we believe that all systems should always use identical packet header/identical responses, in which case the protocol should not permit variation.

Christey> The CD:SF-EXEC and CD:SF-LOC content decisions apply here.
   Since there are 3 separate "executables" with the same
   (or similar) problem, we need to make sure that CD:SF-EXEC
   determines what to do here.  There is evidence that some
   of these .cfm scripts have an "include" file, and if so, 
   then CD:SF-LOC says that we shouldn't make separate entries
   for each of these scripts.  On the other hand, the initial
   L0pht discovery didn't include all 3 of these scripts, and
   as far as I can tell, Allaire had patched the first problem
   before the others were discovered.  So, CD:DISCOVERY-DATE
   may argue that we should split these because the problems
   were discovered and patched at different times.
   
   In any case, this candidate can not be accepted until the

Christey> CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In
   NTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers
   Mnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar
   problem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as
   CVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the "previous report" as
   CVE-1999-0287, which can be found at:
   http://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html
   
   0287 describes an exploit via the "template" hidden variable.
   The exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to
   change the filename to read from the template variable.
   
   The exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable
   directly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also
   encoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to
   the web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287
   and 0467 are the same.
Christey>  
   The CD:SF-EXEC content decision also applies here.  We have 2
   programs, wguest.exe and rguest.exe, which appear to have the
   same problem.  CD:SF-EXEC needs to be accepted by the Editorial
   Board before this candidate can be converted into a CVE
   entry.  When finalized, CD:SF-EXEC will decide whether
   this candidate should be split or not.

   I cannot proceed on this one without further clarification.
Wall> (source: MS:MS99-012)
Prosser> agree with Andre here.  The Untrusted Scripted paste
   vulnerability was originally addressed in MS98-015 and it is in the file
   upload intrinsic control in which an attacker can paste the name of a file
   on the target's drive in the control and a form submission would then send
   that file from the attacked machine to the remote web site.  This one has
   nothing to do with the clipboard.  What the advisory mentioned here,
   MS99-012, does is replace the MSHTML parsing engine which is supposed to fix
   the original Untrusted Scripted Paste issue and a variant, as well as the
   two Cross-Frame variants and a privacy issue in IMG SRC.  
   The vulnerability that allowed reading of a user's clipboard is the Forms
   2.0 Active X control vulnerability discussed in MS99-01

   Here's the nature of the problem.
   (1) FFingerd allows users to decide not to be fingered,
   printing a message "That user does not want to be fingered"
   (2) If the fingered user does not exist, then FFingerd's
   intended default is to print that the user does not
   want to be fingered; however, the error message has a
   period at the end.
   Thus, ffingerd can allow someone to determine who valid users
   on the server are, *in spite of* the intended functionality of
   ffingerd itself.  Thus this exposure should be viewed in light
   of the intended functionality of the application, as opposed
   to the common usage of the finger protocol in general.
   
   Also, the vendor posted a followup and said that a patch was
   available.  See:

Meunier> This relates only to account password technology, so this candidate is
   independent of the operating system, application, web site or other
   application of this technology.  The appropriate (natural) level of
   abstraction is therefore without specifying that it is for UNIX.
   Change the description to "An account has a guessable password other
   than default, null, blank."  This should satisfy Andre's objection.
   
   This Candidate should be merged with any candidate relating to
   account password technology where "Unix" in the original description
   can be replaced by something else.

Voter Comments:
Northcutt> (Though I sympathize with this one :)
CHANGE> [Frech changed vote from REVIEWING to REJECT]
Frech> Ping is a utility that can be run on demand; ICMP echo is a
   message 
   type. As currently worded, this candidate seems as if an arbitrary
   host 
   is vulnerable because it is capable of running an arbitrary program
   or
   function (in this case, ping/ICMP echo). There are many
   programs/functions that 
   'shouldn't' be on a computer, from a security admin's perspective.
   Even if this
   were a vulnerability, it would be impacted by CD-HIGHCARD.
Meunier> Every ICMP message type presents a vulnerability or an
   exposure, if access is not controlled.  By that I mean not only those
   in RFC 792, but also those in RFC 1256, 950, and more.  I think that
   the description should be changed to "ICMP messages are acted upon
   without any access control".  ICMP is an error and debugging protocol.
   We complain about vendors leaving testing backdoors in their programs.
   ICMP is the equivalent for TCP/IP.  ICMP should be in the dog house,
   unless you are trying to troubleshoot something.  MTU discovery is
   just a performance tweak -- it's not necessary.  I don't know of any
   ICMP message type that is necessary if the network is functional.
   Limited logging of ICMP messages could be useful, but acting upon them
   and allowing the modification of routing tables, the behavior of the
   TCP/IP stack, etc... without any form of authentication is just crazy.

   13 and 14 (timestamp request and reply) and 17 and 18 (netmask request
   and reply) are acted upon without any access control".  It's a more
   precise and correct language.  I believe that this is a valid CVE
   entry (it's a common source of vulnerabilities or exposures) even
   though I see that the inferred action was "reject".  Knowing the time
   of a host also allows attacks against random number generators that
   are seeded with the current time.  I want to push to have it accepted.

Voter Comments:
Shostack> Is this a default alias?  Is my .procmailrc an instance of this?
Christey> It is not entirely clear whether the simple fact that an alias
   pipes into a program should be considered a vulnerability.  It
   all depends on the behavior of that particular program.  This
   is one of a number of configuration-related issues from the
   "draft" CVE that came from vulnerability scanners.  In
   general, when we get to general configuration and "policy,"
   it becomes more difficult to use the current CVE model to
   represent them.  So at the very least, this candidate (and
   similar ones) should be given close consideration and
   discussion before being added to the official CVE list.
   
   Because this candidate is related to general configuration
   issues, and we have not completely determined how to handle
   such issues in CVE, this candidate cannot be promoted to an
   official CVE entry until such issues are resolved.
